# Introduction
Welcome to The Last Day, an introductory scenario for an Eberron campaign.

This is designed as a showcase for some aspects of Eberron's lore. It takes place during the Last War, four years before the 'default' start date for an Eberron campaign. It does not need to tie in to your campaign. This scenario uses pre-made 5th level characters, all of which should die in the final scene. 

If you need to adjust the size of the party, add or remove warforged.

## Conventions
Text displayed as a block quote is intended to be read to the player verbatim:

> From your hilltop, you see the town of Bree burning. The gates have been barred, but a mob has gathered and is trying to break the door down before they are consumed.
>
> "Oh. Hum. Didn't mean to do that," said Archmage Rhonin sheepishly.

Text in green boxes contains additional information about an area or NPC. Review these boxes and provide the players with relevant facts.

::: tip The Room
The room is richly furnished with lots of hard wood. The back wall has green silk curtains hanging over it.

If the player looks behind the curtain, they will find an iron safe. The safe has a trap that will do 1d8 poison damage if triggered. Inside, there is a [Vorpal Sword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/vorpal-sword).
