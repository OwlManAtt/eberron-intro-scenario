# On Patrol
- 1st combat should just be some wildlife, keep CR low so the warforged seem impressive as fuck

- Continue patrolling, 2h pass

- See three Brelish Bear Cavalry guys in the distance
    - Tougher fight
        - Warforged should take some damage for the artificer to repair
        - Maybe have like a scout captain druid dude as one of the cavalry
    - After defeating them, the party comes upon a group of civillians w/ enemy supplies
        - They have daggers and leathers, but can't put up a fight
        - Offer to surrender & be taken prisoner
        - Party has no restraints & must focus on mission. -- THERE IS NO GOOD CHOICE.
            - Butcher them?
                - horrifying, artificer makes Horror role for madness or w/e since he's a newbie
            - Take their weapons
                - find them again eaten by wolves or otherwise horribly killed
            - Let them go
                - Show up in the final fight & buff/resupply the enemies
            - March them back to camp under guard
                - All executed by Captain anyway
                - Captain executes sgt & flogs artificer for disobeying orders
