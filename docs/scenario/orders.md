# Orders
The first scene gets the party together & gives them their mission: locating an enemy force before Hillshire is besieged or the Cyre supply trains are attacked.

Two weeks ago, Breland began a major offensive into Cyre, and Cyre has been steadily losing ground. The front lines are thirty miles west of Hillshire -- too close for comfort, but not an immediate problem. The troops stationed here are on alert, but have not seen heavy fighting in five years. Dull explosions can be heard in the distance as artillery staves are fired, and at night towers of flame can be seen.

Many of the veterans have been shifted to the front, leaving the camp with fresh recruits and warforged.

It is 20 Olarune 994 YK, the Day of Mourning. Until the end of the day, Cyre is ruled by Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn.

Captain Azana has been assigned to this post for ten years. Six years ago, Breland laid siege to Hillshire and cut the camp & town off for three months. Forty of her men starved to death. There was talk of cannibalism, both in the camp and inside Hillshire. She will go to great lengths to ensure that never happens again.

::: danger TODO
- have alchemist waiting outside cmdr tent & join immediately, so they can interact w/ camp people before going to QM

- warforged should be helping QM, not sitting in a warehouse
- mix some other races in (halfings, half elves)
- flesh out the cannith encounter (give him a name & stat block)

## Captain's Tent
The scenario begins with one of the player characters, Sergeant Manuel, waiting for Captain Azana in the captain's tent.

> You are all soldiers of the Cyre Royal Army, assigned to protect the town of Hillshire. Your encampment is two miles west of the town, putting you between it and the front line.
>
> One hundred years ago today, the other provinces of your once-great kingdom instigated a civil war. Ever since, Cyre has been besiged on all sides by pretenders wishing to claim the throne.
> 
> Today is not a special day. The last one hundred years of carnage will likely be followed by a hundred more. No nation is strong enough to break Cyre, but Cyre cannot fight a war on five fronts.
> 
> **Sergeant Manuel**: You were summoned to the captain's tent a few minutes ago. You now stand at attention, waiting for her arrival.

The player has a few moments to act before Captain Azana shows up.

::: tip Captain's Tent
The player stands before a fine oak desk, upon which are papers, quills, and an inkpot. A map of the area is in the center of the desk, enchanted to resist ink spills. A few carved wooden pieces are placed upon it to mark troop movements. If the player looks behind the desk, they will find a drawer with more quills, a metal rectangle (the Captain's seal), and a [Wand of Magic Missiles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/wand-of-magic-missiles).

The chair behind the desk is ornate, with a handful of dull gems set into the back and arms.

To the left is a bed with a curtain blocking it from view.

To the right is a large chest (4ft long, 3 ft deep, 3 ft tall) banded with iron. There is no obvious lock. There are magical protections, as well as an [Alarm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/alarm) spell cast upon it. The player will not be able to lift the lid, but the attempt will trigger Alarm.
:::

The captain enters her tent and sits down behind her desk. She shuffles some papers before acknowledging the Sergeant.

If the player attempted to interact with her chest & Alarm alerted her, she will assign the Sergeant a punishment -- latrine duty for a week -- before explaining the mission.

> The captain looks up and finally regards you.
> 
> Sergeant Manuel. At ease. Thank you for waiting. 
> 
> I have been receiving reports that Breland has snuck a whole company of their cavalry behind the front line. A fast-moving unit like that will be able to hit our supply trains, and we absolutely cannot permit another disruption to our food shipments.
> 
> I need you to take a squad out and track Breland's troops down so I can crush them.
>
> I will assign you a few of the Warforged units, but you are **not** to engage unless you have no other choice. You are on a **scouting** mission. 
> 
> And Sergeant, I need these Warforged back in working order. If you have a repeat of last month's performance, I **will** have you flogged. But, I believe in setting my men up for success, so I will assign you an artificer -- if anything breaks, it better be fixed before you come back.
>
> The Captain looks down at her desk and quickly writes up a summary of your conversation. She folds the paper up, opens her desk drawer, and grabs a metal stamp. She places her seal on the paper and hands it to you.
>
> Show this to the quartermaster and they'll get you sorted. Lives are riding on this, Sergeant. Do not let me down. 

If the player removes the Captain's seal from her desk drawer, she will scowl and get a spare from her locked chest, thinking she has misplaced it.

If the player has the stolen Wand of Magic Missile visible, she will realize it has been stolen if she passes a DC 14 perception check and assign a punishment before taking it away.
 
The captain will answer up to three questions from the player before dimissing them.

## The Camp
The Sergeant passes through the camp to see the quartermaster.

::: tip The Camp
The camp is made up mostly of tents arranged in neat rows. There is a wooden pallisade erected around the camp.

There are four human officers and about thirty human troops working or relaxing in the open.

To the north, a fire burns and the camp's two smiths work to repair and maintain equipment. 

To the south, the only permenant structure in the camp stands large: a wooden warehouse where all of the supplies are stored.
:::

If the Sergeant talks to an officer, they will hurry the Sargeant along.

The Sergeant can stop and talk to other troopers. They will mostly be concerned about the Brelish offensive:

|    3 | Brelish being better foes than Karrnath's undead horde |
|    4 | Belief that the scouting reports are wrong             |

The Sergeant can search through unoccupied tents.

## The Quartermaster
The quartermaster is a halfling. He is good-natured, but cannot leave his post for any reason.

> As you approach the supply warehouse, you see a stout halfling sitting in a worn wooden chair by the door. He is reading a book.
> 
> Scattered around his chair are loose papers and a strongbox with the lid opened. Quills and linkpots are sitting in the lid, ready for use.
> 
> The warehouse door is slightly ajar, and you can hear crates being shifted inside.

The quartermaster will not notice the Sargeant unless he speaks or attempts to enter the warehouse.

::: danger Write up the interaction
woo

- Sgt goes to QM
    - QM assigns him some warforged
    - QM calls artificer out of back room & detaches him
    - QM also hands Sgt a Wand of Flare -- instructs him that it has 1 charge, and he can summon backup w/ it

end w/ pointing them to the gate tho

## Leaving Camp
The camp is the same [as before](#the-camp), but there is activity at the gate.

The players can explore the camp further, but if they take more than 10 minutes, Captain Azana turns up and threatens to have them flogged if they do not begin their patrol immediately.

A dozen wagons pulled by Warforged are outside the camp, and a few men are speaking to the camp sentries.

> As you approach the gap in the pallisade, you see your sentry talking to a lithe man wearing well-kept armour -- you can see the sentry's reflection in the man's breastplate.
>
> Parked just outside are a dozen covered wagons, each with a Warforged at its head. It appears that the Warforged were pulling the wagons instead of a horse.
>
> "Sorry, but they told me to deliver four", you overhear the stranger saying. "The rest of these are due in Breland by next week."
>
> The sentry grumbles, but nods his head. "Typical snafu. Eh, not your fault though, me lord Cannith..."
>
> The stranger nods and four Warforged units step out of the wagons. The Cannith man points towards the warehouse, and they lumber past you.

The camp sentry will answer the player's questions. The Cannith man will answer questions, but he will be condescending.

If the players remark about Warforged being delivered to their enemies, the Cannith man will laugh and tell them it is "just business".

If the players make an attack, the camp sentry will try to stop them by reminding the players that Cannith could simply stop selling Cyre new Warforged, which would lead to defeat.

If they persist, the Cannith warforged pulling the wagons will join the Cannith man in combat. Captain Azana will turn up after 2 rounds and break the fight up, apologizing profusely to the Cannith man.
